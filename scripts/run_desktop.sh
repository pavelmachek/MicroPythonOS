# 15 works infinite with 8 images
# 12 seems to work fine with all images now, doing only gc.collect()
# 10-11 works infinite with 7 images but as soon as I add the next one (big PNG slide 2) it hangs memory alloc

# Makes semse because the error is:
# MemoryError: memory allocation failed, allocating 2518043 bytes
# So every new slide needs 2.5MB extra RAM!
# A 1280x720 slide seems to allocate 5530721 bytes, so 6 bytes per pixel... a bit much but okay...

# Fixed by adding lv.image.cache_drop(None) # This helps a lot!

#export HEAPSIZE=16M # 8-10MB is not enough for 1280x720 slides, 16MB seems enough in windowed mode

#export HEAPSIZE=64M # fine for fullscreen 1280x720 slides
